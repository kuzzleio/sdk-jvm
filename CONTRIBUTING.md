# CONTRIBUTING

This file lists the good practices to follow when contributing to this project.

### Committing on `master`

Committing on master triggers a build and a deploy of the package on NuGet, so it must be done cautiously. To commit without triggering the deployment, pre-pend the `[no-deploy]` tag to your commit message.
